# Product Requirements Document (PRD): mybrief

## 1. Introduction/Overview

mybrief is a mobile application designed to help busy professionals, startup founders, and tech enthusiasts stay informed without being overwhelmed by the multitude of information sources (YouTube, newsletters, X/Twitter, Reddit, RSS, etc.). The app curates content from these sources and delivers a minimal, distraction-free, snackable daily digest. Users can customize their feeds, save articles for later, and receive push notifications at their preferred time, all within a super-minimalist interface (see `minimal-digest-design_sample.tsx`).

## 2. Goals

- Aggregate and curate content from multiple sources (RSS, YouTube, Reddit, X/Twitter) into a single daily digest in mybrief.
- Provide a minimal, distraction-free reading experience.
- Allow users to customize their feed sources and use template packs for quick setup.
- Enable users to save articles for later and receive reminders.
- Deliver daily push notifications at user-specified times, respecting user timezones.
- Support sharing of content from the app.

## 3. User Stories

- As a user, I want to quickly set up my own custom feed by adding YouTube channels, subreddits, X accounts, and RSS feeds, so I can see all my favorite content in one place in mybrief.
- As a user, I want to use template packs (e.g., Technology, Entrepreneur) to get started quickly with curated sources.
- As a user, I want to receive a daily push notification at my chosen time, so I can read my digest when it suits me.
- As a user, I want to save interesting articles for later and get reminders to read them.
- As a user, I want to share content from my digest with others.
- As a user, I want a minimal, text-focused interface by default, with the option to enable images.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their account in mybrief.
2. The system must allow users to add/remove feed sources: RSS, YouTube channels, Reddit subreddits, X/Twitter accounts.
3. The system must provide template packs of pre-curated feeds for quick setup.
4. The system must fetch and aggregate new content from all user feeds daily.
5. The system must generate a daily digest, ranking and summarizing content using AI.
6. The system must allow users to save articles/content for later reading.
7. The system must allow users to share articles/content externally.
8. The system must allow users to set their preferred notification time and timezone.
9. The system must send a daily push notification with the new digest at the userâ€™s chosen time.
10. The system must provide reminders for saved articles not yet read.
11. The system must allow users to choose between minimal (text-only) and rich (with images) display modes.
12. The system must provide a minimal, distraction-free UI as per the design sample.
13. The system must allow users to manage (add/remove) their feed sources and template packs after onboarding.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Podcast and newsletter ingestion via unique user email (can be considered for future versions).
- Social features such as following other users or in-app comments.
- Advanced AI features (e.g., YouTube video summarization) for MVP.
- Android support for initial launch (unless otherwise specified).
- In-app purchases or subscription management (unless specified).

## 6. Design Considerations

- Follow the minimalist, ADHD-friendly design as shown in `minimal-digest-design_sample.tsx`.
- Use clear, readable typography and high-contrast themes (light/dark mode toggle).
- Prioritize text content, with optional image support.
- Simple navigation: Home (Digest), Saved, Feeds, Settings.
- Use template packs for onboarding and feed management.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Use React Native with Expo for cross-platform development.
- Use Supabase for backend (auth, database, edge functions, push notifications).
- Use OpenAI GPT-4 for content ranking and summarization.
- Schedule content fetching and notification delivery using Supabase Edge Functions and Cron.
- Store user preferences (feeds, notification time, display mode) in Supabase.
- Ensure timezone-aware scheduling for notifications.
- Use Expo Push Notifications for reliable delivery.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Daily active users (DAU) and retention rates.
- Digest open rates and average time spent in app.
- Number of articles saved and read later.
- User engagement with template packs and custom feeds.
- Push notification delivery and open rates.
- User feedback on minimalism and focus.

## 9. Open Questions

- Should Android support be included in the MVP, or is iOS-only sufficient for launch?
- Should there be any limits on the number of feeds a user can add?
- What is the minimum set of template packs to include at launch?
- Should users be able to import OPML files for bulk RSS feed import?
- Any specific analytics or privacy requirements?
- Should there be onboarding tips or a tutorial for first-time users?
